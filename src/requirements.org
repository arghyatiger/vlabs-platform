  1. Untether authoring of content from delivery of content.
     - Content authoring includes:
       + building an experiment also known as simulation that is always software and
       + writing text around this experiment.
     - Delivery of content, the content can be delivered either from 
       + MOOC platforms like Open edX, Google Course Builder, Moodle etc.
         These are also known as learning management systems (LMS). 
       + or from a custom delivery platform built by VLEAD.

     The advantage of using an existing MOOC platform is that the functions of
     single sign on, persistence, analytics, uniform UI are built into the platform.  With
     a VLEAD delivery platform, these functions will have to be built.

  2. The platform provides single sign on.

  3. The platform provides persistence.

  4. The platform provides a mechanism to capture analytics of usage of virtual
     labs.

  5. The platform provides a uniform look and feel.
