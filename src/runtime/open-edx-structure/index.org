* Introduction
   This document demonstrates the creation of a skeletal structure for a lab in
   the format expected by Open edX platform from a lab specification.

* How to generate OpenedX structure? 
- Step 1 :: Create a directory with the lab name (all letters in lower-case
     with hyphens) which is to be ported on Open edX.  
- Step 2 :: The =labspec.json= file need to created and place inside the lab
     directory.  Please refer to the example [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-specifications/blob/master/IIIT-Hyderabad/artificial-neural-networks-labspec.json][labspec.json]] file
- Step 3 :: Run the following command to generate the OpenedX Structure
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
git clone https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-platform.git
cd vlabs-platform/
make
cd build/code/runtime/
python automation.py <absolute-path-to-lab-directory> 
#+END_EXAMPLE
- Step 4 :: Compress the lab directory into a tar.gz file using command 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd ..
tar -cvzf name-of-archive.tar.gz <path-to-lab-directory>
#+END_EXAMPLE
- Step 5 :: Create a course in Open edX Studio and import the compressed tar.gz
     lab directory to course that is created in Open edX studio.
